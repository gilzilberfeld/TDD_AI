I'm coding a calculator in Java.
This calculator has two APIs

void press(string key);
string getDisplay();

The calculator has the following rules:
- It can accept any digit key
- It can add and divide
- Each press is a single key, sent as single character
- It has a plus, div and equal keys
- If display is more than 5 characters it displays E
- If dividing by zero it displays E
- If pressing a digit it shows the digit
- If pressing plus or div the display doesn't change
- Pressing equal displays the calculation result.

Please create a set of tests that check the implementation. Do not create the implementation.
